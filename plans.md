#### Plans
1. i wanna add this stuff to a Kubernetes cluster (not preferrably in minikube because it might break my pc).
2. i was originally planning to use 3 replicaes per reader/writer service, but since my local system cant handle this much load, i simply used one per Node.
3. CI/CD for each of the microservices(I might not do this though as not needed for a small single-node system).
